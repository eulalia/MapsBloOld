<p>The map below is an example of an interactive map made with datawrapper.
It shows the evolution of a number of Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) in the EU. It is embedded here by means of a responsive iframe from the Datawrapper platform
<iframe title="Functional urban areas that have grown or not in the last years" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Di6Px" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Di6Px/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="644" height="817"></iframe></p>
<p>You can also embed images. See [here (fig:Di6Px)] for an static image of the above map:</p>
